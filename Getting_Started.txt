First things first, download a distribution of Python if you haven't done so already. The following are a few great platforms:
1) Anaconda Python   https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda/
2) Spyder Python        https://code.google.com/p/spyderlib/

Next, Learn about Python as a data-science tool with the book Python For Data Analysis, 
which is a great intro book to Python. (This book can be downloaded at http://dl.e-book-free.com/2013/07/python_for_data_analysis.pdf). 
The author of this book gives a great tutorial on Python at this link https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w26x-z-BdWQ

Since this group will use Github for code collaboration, 
follow the link to learn how to use Git as a version control application.
